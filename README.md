> Parse Kindle Highlights for Evernote

<hr>

Highlights from [the new Kindle Highlights](https://kindle.amazon.com/your_highlights) are of the form:

> Yellow highlight | Page: 301

> â€œI deny that there is any natural or divine law requiring that machines, efficiency, and organization should forever increase in scope, power, and complexity, in peace as in war. I see the growth of these now, rather, as the result of a dangerous lack of law.
> -*Player Piano* by Kurt Vonnegut

I want to reshape these into the below format for transfer to Evernote:

>I deny that there is any natural or divine law requiring that machines, efficiency, and organization should forever increase in scope, power, and complexity, in peace as in war. I see the growth of these now, rather, as the result of a dangerous lack of law. (pg 301)

The [KindleHighlights Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/mkudija/Kindle-Highlights/blob/master/KindleHighlights.ipynb) performs this.
